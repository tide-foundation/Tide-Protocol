				Tide Community Open Source License

	Preamble:
	  The Tide Community Open Source License is a copyright License for 
	software and other kinds of works designed to encourage the adoption 
	of the Tide Protocol.  The aim of the Tide Protocol is to create the 
	technological infrastructure to drive the new personal data economy, 
	addressing the data sovereignty needs of consumers, the 
	revenue-generating and cost minimization needs of vendors who collect 
	data from consumers, and the data reliability needs of seekers of 
	consumer data.

	  To that end, the Tide Community Open Source License gives you the 
	freedom to modify and distribute copies of software and other works 
	for free, or for a fee, as long as you do so in accordance with these 
	terms and the software adopts the Tide Protocol in full.

	License Terms
	Version: 1
	Date of last revision: 8 May 2019

	1	Acceptance of these terms
	  (a)	These terms are between the copyright holder (“we”, “us” and 
			“our”) identified in the notice embedded in or provided with 
			the source code, technical documentation or other material 
			relating to the Tide Foundation Limited’s (ACN 630 011 371) 
			(“Tide”) data encryption and exchange platform 
			known as the “Tide Protocol” (“Tide Protocol”) and with which 
			these terms are packaged (“Materials”)  and the person or 
			entity (“you” and “your”) accessing and/or using the Materials.
	  (b)	By using, modifying or publishing the Materials or any Modified
			Materials (as defined in clause 2(c) below), you agree to be 
			bound by these terms.  If you are doing any of the foregoing in 
			the context of your employment with your employer or on behalf 
			of another entity, you are agreeing to be bound by these terms 
			on behalf of that employer or other entity and you represent 
			and warrant that you have the authority of that employer or 
			other entity to enter into these terms on their behalf. In such 
			circumstances, each reference in these terms “you” or “your” 
			includes that employer or other entity. 
	  (c)	These terms will remain in effect until terminated under 
			clause 9.

	2	Intellectual property rights
	  (a)	In these terms, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all 
			intellectual property rights of whatever nature throughout the 
			world, including all rights conferred under statute, common 
			law or equity, whether existing now or at any time in the 
			future, including all rights in and to any patents, patent 
			applications, business names, trade names, domain names, trade 
			marks, copyright, trade secrets, circuit layout rights, 
			designs, confidential information, know-how, technical 
			information, data or developments. All of our Intellectual 
			Property Rights are protected by the laws in force in 
			Australia from time to time.
	  (b)	You acknowledge and agree that we (or our licensors) retain all
			right, title, and interest (including all Intellectual Property 
			Rights) in and to the Materials, and nothing you do with or in 
			relation to the Materials will transfer any right, title or 
			interest (including Intellectual Property Rights) to you or 
			License or otherwise permit you to exercise any Intellectual 
			Property Rights except as expressly granted under these terms.
	  (c)	In these terms, “Modified Materials” means any work based on 
			one or more of the Materials, including a revision, 
			modification, adaptation, subset, addition, enhancement, 
			improvement, combination, translation, abridgment, 
			condensation, expansion, collection, compilation or any other 
			form in which such Materials may be recast, transformed or 
			adapted or any other new material derived from the Materials.

	3	Your License to the Materials 
	  (a)	Subject to paragraph (c) below and your compliance with these 
			terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive,  
			non-sub-licensable, revocable, worldwide, royalty free License 
			for the term of these terms to access, use, copy, modify, 
			adapt, distribute, publish and exploit the Materials, provided 
			that such License is exercised:
			(i)		solely in connection with the adoption and use of the 
					Tide Protocol;
			(ii)	solely in a manner which requires any payment or 
					exchange of value to be made via Tide Tokens (as 
					defined in paragraph (c) below); and
			(iii)	in accordance with clause 6 and on these terms in 
					respect of the right to distribute and publish the 
					Materials and Modified Materials.
			The foregoing rights to distribute, publish and exploit the 
			Materials include the right to do so for a fee and applies 
			in respect of the Materials and the Modified Materials. 
	  (b)	Any access, use, copy, modification, adaptation, distribution, 
			publication or exploitation of any of the Materials for use 
			with applications that do not fully use, adopt and implement 
			the Tide Protocol is prohibited. This prohibition includes any 
			use or adaptation of the Materials for the purposes of any 
			protocol, system or platform competing with the Tide Protocol 
			or which facilitates any form of payment or exchange of value 
			other than through use of Tide Tokens (as defined in paragraph 
			(c) below). 
	  (c)	Without limiting paragraph (b), the License granted under 
			paragraph (a) does not permit you to, and in exercising the 
			rights granted to you under paragraph (a) you must not, under 
			any circumstances:
			(i)		remove, omit or in any way modify any component of the 
					Materials, including source code components, which 
					requires payment or exchange of value to be made via 
					Tide cryptographic tokens designed for settling 
					transactions entered into via the Tide Protocol (“Tide 
					Tokens”); 
			(ii)	use the Materials which are source code or object code:
				(A)		in combination with any other code, script or 
						software (whether in source or object code form), 
						or otherwise in any manner, which would in any way 
						circumvent the requirement for any payment or 
						exchange of value to be made via Tide Tokens; or
				(B)		in any other way which does not properly use, adopt 
						and implement the Tide Protocol in its entirety, 
						including for the purposes of both data encryption 
						and data exchange;  
			(iii)	violate any applicable laws or any rights of any person, 
					or use or permit or facilitate the use of the Materials 
					in any manner or for any purpose that is unlawful or is 
					in breach of any laws of jurisdiction anywhere in the 
					world;
			(iv)	distribute viruses, spyware, corrupted files, or any 
					other similar software or programs that may damage the 
					operation of any computer hardware or software, or the 
					Tide Protocol; or
			(v)		engage in any other conduct that is improper or brings 
					or is likely to bring us, the Materials, the Tide 
					Protocol or Tide Tokens into disrepute,
			and you must ensure that where any third party is being engaged 
			to make modifications to the Materials on your behalf, their 
			rights to do so are subject to terms which incorporate the 
			restrictions in this clause 3.
	  (d)	You must take your own precautions to ensure that the processes 
			which you employ for accessing and using the Materials do not 
			expose you to the risk of viruses, malicious computer code or 
			other forms of interference which may damage your computer 
			systems.  We recommend that you install and use up-to-date 
			anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall software on your computer 
			systems.  

	4	Data security and privacy	
	  You are fully responsible for ensuring:
	  (a)	any use, adoption or implementation of the Materials, any 
			Modified Materials and/or the Tide Protocol appropriately 
			protects, encrypts and stores data; and 
	  (b)	all aspects of compliance with privacy and data protection laws. 
	  We disclaim all warranties and liability regarding the same.
	  
	5	Modification of Tide Protocol and Materials 
	  You acknowledge that Tide may at any time without notice to you change 
	  or update the whole or any part of the Tide Protocol and/or any of the 
	  Materials, including in a manner which may result in applications or 
	  processes you may have developed or implemented no longer being 
	  compatible or otherwise working in the same manner with the Tide 
	  Protocol or any Material, including any software development kit. We 
	  may also withdraw or remove any part of the Materials or the Tide 
	  Protocol at any stage without notice to you.

	6	Distribution 
	  (a)	Without limiting clause 3, in exercising the rights granted to 
			you under clause 3(a) to distribute or publish one or more 
			copies of any Materials verbatim as you receive the Materials,
			you may do so in any medium, provided that:
		(i)		you provide all recipients of the Materials with a copy of 
				these terms along with the Materials: 
		(ii)	you keep intact and do not remove, omit, or in any way 
				modify any of the following:
			(A)		any notices stating that these License terms apply; 
			(B)		any hyperlink to these License terms; and
			(C)		any notices of the absence of any warranty;
	  (b)	You may charge any price or no price for each copy of the 
			Materials or Modified Materials that you distribute or publish,
			and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
	  (c)	Without limiting clause 3, in exercising the rights granted to 
			you under clause 3(a) to distribute or publish one or more 
			copies of any Modified Materials you create or cause to be 
			created, you may do so in any medium, provided that:
		(i)		you provide all recipients of the Modified Materials with 
				a copy of these terms along with the Modified Materials; 
		(ii)	you keep intact and do not remove, omit, or in any way 
				modify any of the following:
			(A)		any notices stating that these License terms apply to 
					the unmodified Materials;
			(B)		any hyperlink to these License terms; and
			(C)		any notices of the absence of any warranty in respect 
					of the unmodified Materials; and
		(iii)	the whole of any Modified Materials must be licensed under 
				these terms (although this does not limit the operation of 
				paragraph (d)), but you may impose further restrictions 
				that do not conflict with or override these terms.
	  (d)	Where you compile any source code Materials or Modified 
			Materials in an aggregate with any proprietary program, the 
			Materials remain governed by these License terms. For the 
			purposes of the foregoing, a compilation of any Materials with 
			other separate and independent works, which are not by their 
			nature extensions of the Materials, and which are not combined 
			with the Materials such as to form a larger program, in or on 
			a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is an “aggregate” 
			if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to 
			limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users 
			beyond what the individual Materials permit. Inclusion of any 
			Materials in an aggregate does not cause these terms to apply 
			to the other parts of the aggregate.
	  (e)	You may not initiate any proceedings or claims in respect of 
			infringement of any patent rights in respect of the access, 
			use, copy, modification, adaptation, distribution, publication 
			or exploitation of any of the Materials or Modified Materials 
			in accordance with these terms.

	7	Liability
	  (a)	All express or implied guarantees, warranties, representations, 
			statements, terms or conditions relating to these terms or the 
			Materials that are not contained in these terms, are excluded 
			to the maximum extent permitted by law. Without limiting the 
			foregoing:
		(i)		the Materials are provided ‘as-is’ and neither we nor Tide 
				warrant or represent that they will work in any way, that 
				they are fit for any particular purpose, that your 
				requirements will be met, that your use of the Materials 
				will be uninterrupted or error free or that the Materials 
				are free of viruses or other harmful components; and
		(ii)	we and Tide are not responsible for any loss, corruption or 
				interception of data which occurs in connection with your 
				use or misuse of the Materials.
	  (b)	Nothing in these terms excludes, restricts or modifies any 
			guarantee, term, condition, warranty, or any right or remedy, 
			implied or imposed by any law which cannot lawfully be excluded 
			or limited. (a “Non-Excludable Provision”). If any guarantee, 
			term, condition or warranty is implied into these terms under a 
			Non-Excludable Provision and we or Tide can limit your remedy 
			for a breach of the Non-Excludable Provision, then our and 
			Tide’s liability for breach of the Non-Excludable Provision is 
			limited to one or more of the following at our option:
		(i)		in the case of goods, the replacement of the goods or the 
				supply of equivalent goods, the repair of the goods, the 
				payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring 
				equivalent goods, or the payment of the cost of having the 
				goods repaired; or
		(ii)	in the case of services, the supplying of the services 
				again, or the payment of the cost of having the services 
				supplied again. 
	  (c)	To the maximum extent permitted by law but despite any other 
			clause in these terms, your use of the Materials is at your own 
			risk and neither we nor Tide are liable to you for any loss or 
			damage you (or any of your representatives or sub-licensees) 
			suffer, sustain or incur in connection with these terms, 
			exercise of any rights granted under these terms or otherwise 
			in connection with any access or use of the Materials, including 
			in respect of any loss, corruption or interception of data or 
			breach of privacy or security.  
	  (d)	Without limiting paragraph (c), to the maximum extent permitted 
			by law, neither we nor Tide are not liable to you for and no 
			measure of damages will under any circumstances include: 
		(i)		special, indirect, consequential, incidental or punitive 
				damages; or
		(ii)	damages for loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, 
				opportunity, anticipated savings or loss or corruption of 
				data.
	  (e)	The exclusions and limitations of liability in this clause 8 
			apply regardless of the basis on which such liability arises, 
			whether in contract, breach of warranty, tort (including 
			negligence), in equity, under statute, under an indemnity or 
			on any other basis.
	  (f)	You will indemnify us and hold us, Tide and each of our 
			directors, officers, employees and contractors harmless from 
			and against any loss suffered or incurred by us or any of 
			those indemnified, arising out of or in connection with: 
		(i)		your or any of your sub-licensee’s access or use of any of 
				the Materials or any other exercise of any of the rights 
				granted to you under these terms in connection with any of 
				the Materials;
		(ii)	your negligence or breach of these terms; 
		(iii)	your violation of any applicable law or infringement of any 
				rights (including Intellectual Property Rights) of a third 
				party; or
		(iv)	any claim made by any third party arising out of or in 
				connection with any Modified Materials, including any 
				application developed using any of the Materials, and 
				including in respect of infringement of any person’s 
				Intellectual Property Rights. 
	8	Termination
	  (a)	Your License to use the Materials under clause 3(a) immediately 
			and automatically terminates without the need for us to give 
			notice to you if you breach these terms.
	  (b)	You may terminate these terms at any time by ceasing all use 
			and removing all implementations of the Materials and the Tide 
			Protocol.
	  (c)	Upon termination of these terms, all rights and Licenses 
			granted to you under these terms will also terminate and you 
			must immediately cease using the Materials and remove all 
			implementations of the Materials. 
	9	General
	  (a)	You remain fully responsible and liable for the acts and 
			omissions of any third party to whom you subcontract the 
			exercise or performance any of your rights or obligations under 
			these terms, as if such acts and omissions were your acts and 
			omissions. 
	  (b)	If any part of these terms is held to be unenforceable, the 
			unenforceable part is to be given effect to the greatest extent 
			possible and the remainder will remain in full force and effect.   
	  (c)	No waiver, delay or failure by us to take any action shall 
			constitute or be construed as a waiver of that or any other term, 
			condition, option, privilege or right we may have.
	  (d)	The word “including” when used in these terms is not a term of 
			limitation.

	====================
	End of License terms
	====================

	If you develop a Modified Material and want to assert your copyright, 
	attach the following notices to the Modified Material. It is best to 
	attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state 
	the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least the 
	“copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
