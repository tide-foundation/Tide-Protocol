# What is <span class="tide-blue">Tide Protocol</span>?

Tide Protocol enables the protection of sensitive data entrusted to businesses, using a Zero-Trust Custody layer (a decentralized network of autonomous, trustless nodes) that holds and operates the keys, as a virtual gatekeeper, on behalf of the consumer.

## The Benefits

The beneficiaries of Tide are those organizations and businesses that is handling sensitive consumer data (e.g. from health providers, government services, banks, e-commerce and payment platforms etc.).
Tide removes the compounding liability and risk these organizations carry when handling sensitive consumer data, by near eliminating the possibility of a mass data breach and easing compliance with complex privacy legislation.
The solution is a technology that enables those organizations to hand the only key to that sensitive data to their consumers. In other words, Tide has created a model that provides incentive for organizations to embrace privacy and individuals' data sovereignty.

## How it Works

Tide encrypts data held by the business and hands the key to the consumer.
The keys are effectively fragmented and distributed across the Tide network, along with instructions on when to operate the key on the consumer's behalf. Each node is blind to the relevance of its fragment or the part it plays in decryption of the data â€“ all with absolutely no change to the user experience.
